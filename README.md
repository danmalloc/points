#### This is a bot made by the [devcord discord server](https://discord.gg/devcord) with the discord.js javascript library.

This is how the bot works:
Every message that you send gives you points! For all messages sent on our server in the help category you get **5 points** per message. If a members thanks you, the bot will try to detect whom he/she thanked and give **10 points** to the person. All other messages are 1 point a piece.

This is an open source repository, meaning we allow you to contribute on our repository and beautify it! You can fork this repository and clone it on your local machine through git. When you want to submit changes, you can create a pr and if your changes to the repository looks good, one of the moderators will accept the request and merge the changes into the repository
